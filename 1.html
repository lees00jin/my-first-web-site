<h4> Scarlett Johansson & Joaquin Phoenix </h4>
영화 <u>Her</u>에 등장하는 <strong>OST</strong> 입니다.<p>I'm lying on the moon
My dear, I'll be there soon
It's a quiet starry place
Time's we're swallowed up in space
We're here a million miles away
There's things I wish I knew
There's no thing I'd keep from you
It's a dark and shiny place
<img src="song.jpg">
</p>
But with you my dear, I'm safe
And we're a million miles away
We're lying on the moon
It's a perfect afternoon
Your shadow follows me all day
Making sure that I'm okay
And we're a million miles away
A million miles away
A million miles away
